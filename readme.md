This library provides the source code for assembly simulations
of elastic shells around fluctuating lattice gas cargo.

Details of the model and its Monte Carlo moves can be found in [Rotskoff & Geissler arXiv:1709.00321](https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.00321).

This software is distributed under the GPL-3 license and you are free to adapt, modify, and reuse it in other free software.
