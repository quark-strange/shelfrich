This library provides the source code for assembly simulations
of elastic shells around fluctuating lattice gas cargo.

Details of the model and its Monte Carlo moves can be found in our paper: 

  [Robust nonequilibrium pathways to microcompartment assembly](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1802499115).
  
Also available on the [arXiv:1709.00321](https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.00321).

This software is distributed under the GPL-3 license and you are free to adapt, modify, and reuse it in other free software.

It should be noted that this is special purpose software. It may not be robust in all applications or outside the parameter regime in which it was originally developed.
